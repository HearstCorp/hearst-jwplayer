# Hearst JWPlayer

This is the HearstCorp repository for versioning the commercial version of the
player. Maintaining this repo allows us to more easily upgrade the video-player
repository without having to keep the files there, as well as pull in
the latest jwplayer version ahead of time. For more information on how to
update this repository, please see
